StrokeofGenus: a pipeline to identify distinct transcriptomic states and conservation of gene expression patterns across studies, tissues, and species in bulk RNA-seq. 
StrokeofGenus identifies orthology across species without the need for a reference genome to enable comparison of gene expression in non-model organisms and uses machine learning for the discovery of data structure and comparison across datasets.
It is able to identify transcriptomically distinct (and indistinct) states and cross-study conservation of gene expression programs. By identifying conserved gene expression programs across species, we demonstrate the presence of shared molecular mechanisms.
